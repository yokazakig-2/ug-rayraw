# Introduction

CIRASAME is a readout electronics for multi-MPPCs using [CITIROC 1A ASIC](https://www.caen.it/products/citiroc-1a/).
This board is dedicated to readout 8x8 (64ch) array type MPPC with SAMTEC ST4-20-1.00-L-D-P-TR connectors, such as S13361-2050AE-08.
To readout other MPPCs, an intermediate board changing a connector type is necessary.
